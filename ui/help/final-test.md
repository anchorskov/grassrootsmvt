# Final Test Page Instructions

This end-to-end regression page runs through the full volunteer journey in a controlled environment.

1. Follow the prompts step-by-step (login, pick an activity, log a contact, submit notes).  
2. Each section includes pass/fail indicators; ensure everything turns green before release.  
3. Attach screenshots of failures when filing bugs.  
4. Reset the page after each run so cached data doesn’t skew results.

Only staff/testers should use this page. Volunteers can ignore it.
