# Browser Test Page Instructions

This diagnostic checks whether your browser supports the APIs we rely on (fetch, clipboard, sessionStorage, etc.).

## How to Run
1. Open the page in each browser/device you plan to use.
2. Click “Start Test.” Each capability turns green (supported) or red (unsupported).
3. If something fails, note the browser + version and switch to a supported option before volunteering.
4. Share failures with the dev team so we can document workarounds.

The test does not send any personal data—only capability flags.
