# Home Page Instructions

This is the entry landing page for volunteers. It provides quick navigation plus the latest alerts.

## What to Do
1. **Check the alert banner** for any urgent notices (weather, timing, new scripts).
2. **Review your available actions** – cards or buttons link to canvassing, phone banking, contact forms, and admin tools if you have access.
3. **Need a state district focus?** Flip on “Focus by state district” to unlock the District Type (House or Senate) and District selectors. They’re only for volunteers targeting specific legislative turf; leave the toggle off for normal county/city work.
4. **Select one or more affiliations** – use the party chips to focus on Allied registered voters (R, D, unaffiliated) before you launch calls or canvassing.
5. **Open the status panel** (if visible) to confirm you are logged in with the right email, then pick your workflow—each card explains its requirements (device, phone list, etc.).

## Need Help?
- Use the help toggle to see page-specific walkthroughs.
- If a card is greyed out, it means you are missing permissions; contact the organizer listed in the support footer.
