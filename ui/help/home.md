# Home Page Instructions

This is the entry landing page for volunteers. It now centers everything around three quick actions so you only see the tools you intend to use.

## Quick Actions
1. **Add/Update Voter** – jumps directly to the contact-entry form. Use it when you need to record a brand-new voter or patch a household request; it doesn’t load any targeting tools.
2. **County/City Targeting** – reveals the county/city filters plus party + voter count controls. Pick a county (and optional city), choose the parties you want, and then launch calls or canvassing.
3. **House/Senate Targeting** – now starts with the district picker. Select House or Senate, pick the district code, then choose whether you’re calling or canvassing. If you choose canvassing, a city dropdown appears that only lists communities within that district—pick one or leave it on “any” before you continue to the street/house workflow.

Switching quick actions collapses the unused flows and updates the helper text above the controls, so you always know which mode you’re working in.

## Flow Tips
- Party chips and voter count controls are shared across the county/city and district flows—tweak them after you pick a quick action.
- In House/Senate mode, the helper blurb under the district controls tells you when city options are ready. Use “any” for canvassing whole districts, or choose a specific city before heading to the street selector.
- If you land on the page with query parameters in the URL, the matching quick action activates automatically so you can pick up where you left off.

## Need Help?
- Use the help toggle to see page-specific walkthroughs.
- If a card is greyed out, it means you are missing permissions; contact the organizer listed in the support footer.
