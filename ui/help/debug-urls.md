# Debug URLs Page Instructions

This internal utility lists the various environment URLs (local, preview, production) used by the Worker.

1. Use it to confirm which hostname you are currently on.  
2. Copy the URLs when filing bug reports—include the exact environment to speed up triage.  
3. Verify that Access-protected endpoints show the proper prefix before switching environments.  
4. Close the page when done; volunteers do not need this during regular outreach.
