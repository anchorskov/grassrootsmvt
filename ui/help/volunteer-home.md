# Volunteer Dashboard Instructions

This page greets volunteers after login and highlights their current assignments.

## Checklist
1. Confirm the welcome banner shows your name/email—if not, refresh or re-authenticate.
2. Review the “Today’s Priorities” list for task suggestions (call bank, canvass shift, data entry).
3. Use the quick tiles to open each workflow. Tiles may include countdowns or quotas.
4. Skim the “Need Support?” box for Slack/phone contacts if you run into issues.

## Tips
- Keep this tab open while you work; it acts as a base station.
- Watch for red badges that indicate new instructions or script updates.
