# Unified Contact Form Instructions

This page now handles both new entries and voter updates. Every submission still lands in `voter_contact_staging` for reviewer approval.

## Steps
1. **Start with the last name search.** Type at least two letters of the last name (first name optional). We never search or unlock the form on first name alone. Add a city/county if you know it to narrow the results.
2. **Review the matches.** Use the match score plus the address/party to decide. Click **Use this voter** to load the record, or hit **No Match · Add New Contact** to capture someone brand new (the names you typed will prefill the form).
3. **Confirm details.** Once the form unlocks, review the prefilled address, party, support level, and contact fields. Update anything that changed in your conversation.
4. **Record the interaction.** Log the contact method, notes, follow‑up flag, tags, and explicit Pulse consent. Use the script: _“With your permission we can send brief campaign updates by text or email. Message/data rates may apply and you can reply STOP any time. Is that okay?”_
5. **Submit.** The staging team receives every entry. Use the success screen buttons to add another contact or jump back to your previous workflow.

## Reminders
- Always run the lookup before filling the form, even for new voters. This prevents duplicates.
- Note voter communication preferences; never store sensitive data (SSNs, full DOBs, etc.).
- Mention special requests (yard signs, volunteers, donations) using tags so admins can triage quickly.
