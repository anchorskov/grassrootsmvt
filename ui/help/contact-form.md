# New Contact Form Instructions

Use this form to log a brand-new contact (door, phone, event) when you don’t already see the voter in our quick lists.

## Steps
1. **Select county & city** – This scopes autocomplete suggestions to the right region.
2. **Add voter info** – First/last name, street, unit, and ZIP are required. Use the autocomplete hints when available, and always capture the voter’s best cell number and email so we can stay in touch.
3. **Record interaction details & consent** – Pick the contact method, support level, follow-up status, notes, and mark whether the voter opted into Pulse updates. Use the script: _“With your permission we can send brief campaign updates by text or email. Message/data rates may apply and you can reply STOP any time. Is that okay?”_
4. **Attach tags** – Tag special requests (yard sign, volunteer, donation) so admins can filter later.
5. **Submit** – The button labels will indicate whether you’re logging a new supporter or updating an existing one.

## Reminders
- Use sentence fragments for notes—short and factual.
- If you realize the voter already exists, click the “Update existing voter” prompt to jump to the update form instead.
- Never store confidential info (SSNs, full DOB, etc.) in the notes.
- If the voter declines texts or emails, note the preference so future organizers honor it.
