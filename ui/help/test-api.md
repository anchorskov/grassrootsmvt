# API Test Page Instructions

This sandbox issues sample requests to the Worker API so you can confirm connectivity.

## Usage
1. Choose the endpoint from the dropdown (e.g., `/api/ping`, `/api/contact`).
2. Provide any body payload required by the request.
3. Click “Send” to run the call; results appear in the response panel with status codes.
4. Share the output when reporting issues so engineers can reproduce.

## Notes
- Only run test requests you understand—this page hits live data.
- Auth headers are automatically forwarded because you’re already behind Cloudflare Access.
