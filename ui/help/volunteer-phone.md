# Volunteer Phone Page Instructions

This streamlined interface is for callers logging rapid outbound dials without leaving the volunteer dashboard.

## Steps
1. **Review the assigned contact list** shown near the top (script, city, target group).
2. **Start at the first contact card**—phone numbers include confidence ratings so you know which ones might be landlines.
3. **Use the quick buttons** (`Connected`, `Left VM`, `Bad Number`, `Remove`) to record outcomes fast.
4. **Confirm cell/email & Pulse consent**—When you speak with someone, double-check their best mobile number and email. Ask for Pulse opt-in so we can send occasional texts/emails with polling locations, district candidate links, and voting reminders. Script: _“With your permission we can send brief campaign updates by text or email. Message/data rates may apply and you can reply STOP any time. Is that okay?”_ Record the consent plus the contact info.
5. **Add notes** when something actionable happens (callback request, new address, support level).
6. **Move to the next contact**; the page auto-scrolls to keep you in flow.

## Etiquette
- Introduce yourself and the campaign every time—even if the number looks familiar.
- Never share personal phone numbers or track donation information here. Use approved forms only.
- Note any opt-out requests immediately so the team stops contacting that number.
