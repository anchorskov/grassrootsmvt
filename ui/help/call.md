# Call Page Instructions

Use this page to make or log volunteer phone calls. It handles prefilled voters (from canvass) or ad-hoc lookups.

## Flow
1. **Confirm the voter info** at the top (name, phone confidence, prior notes).
2. **Review / select the suggested script**:
   - Leave the toggle on to show the current campaign script. Turn it off if you prefer to work free-form.
   - Pick a topic from the dropdown (Child Care, SNAP, Healthcare, Term Limits, etc.) to lock in that message. “Auto” lets the system choose the best fit for each voter.
   - The icebreaker automatically plugs in your volunteer name (“Hi, this is Jamie…”). Read it verbatim, then continue to the talking points and CTA.
   - If you change topics mid-call, the script card refreshes immediately with the new copy.
3. **Confirm contact channels and Pulse consent** – Ask for the voter’s preferred cell number and email. If they agree to Pulse updates (texts/emails with polling directions, district candidate links, and voting-date reminders), record the info and mark the opt-in with the script: _“With your permission we can send brief campaign updates by text or email. Message/data rates may apply and you can reply STOP any time. Is that okay?”_
4. **Select the outcome** (Connected, No Answer, Wrong Number, etc.) and capture any notes.
5. **Schedule follow-up** if the voter requested it; choose the time box or add a tag like `callback`.
6. **Submit**—the page auto-returns you to your source (phone list or canvass).

## Tips
- When launched from a canvass card, the voter data is preloaded; no manual searching required.
- Use headphones when possible to ensure privacy.
- Don’t leave detailed personal info or donation data in the notes—stick to campaign-approved fields.
- If the voter opts out of texts or email, note it explicitly so future callers know to skip the Pulse ask.
