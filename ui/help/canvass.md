# Canvass Page Instructions

Welcome! Use this guide while knocking doors so you always know the next step.

1. **Set your filters** – County, city, and party filters in the page URL determine which addresses load.
2. **Enter the street name first** – Start typing the street, pick the autocomplete suggestion, then enter the house number.
3. **Adjust range & limit** – The sliders decide how many nearby addresses you’ll see at once. The default is ±20 houses and 20 results.
4. **Tap “Find nearby”** – We’ll query the voter file and show you formatted voter cards, including past contact results.
5. **Log outcomes**  
   - `📋 Contact` opens the detailed contact form for that voter.  
   - `🚪 Not Home` records a quick outcome.  
   - `📝 Note` opens the update form to add detailed notes.  
   - `Call` routes you to the phone interface if a number exists.
6. **Confirm contact channels & ask for Pulse opt-in** – Before you leave the door, double-check the voter’s best cell number and email. If they agree to receive occasional “Pulse” texts or emails (polling place directions, district candidate links, early/primary reminders), record the new contact info and mark consent in the contact form. Use the script: _“With your permission we can send brief campaign updates by text or email. Message/data rates may apply and you can reply STOP any time. Is that okay?”_
7. **Watch the status chips** – Chips show party, phone confidence, and past outcomes so you can tailor the conversation quickly.
8. **Need to pause?** – Toggle the help switch back off to return to the canvass list without losing your place.
