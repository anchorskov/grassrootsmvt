# Volunteer Canvass Page Instructions

This is the simplified canvass workflow embedded under `/volunteer/`. It’s optimized for phones and tablets.

## How to Use
1. Confirm your assigned turf (county/city) in the banner.
2. Tap the first address card to reveal residents and prior outcomes.
3. Use the large buttons (`Contacted`, `Not Home`, `Note`, `Call`) after each attempt.
4. Capture quick notes—keep them short so admins can triage later.
5. Confirm the best cell number and email, then ask for **Pulse** opt-in so we can send occasional texts/emails with polling directions, district candidate info, and key voting dates. Script: _“With your permission we can send brief campaign updates by text or email. Message/data rates may apply and you can reply STOP any time. Is that okay?”_ Log consent plus the contact info when granted.
6. Swipe to the next card; completed addresses grey out automatically.

## Field Reminders
- Always record “Not Home” so turf leads know you attempted the door.
- Respect “No Soliciting” signs and mark “Do Not Contact” when requested.
- If someone declines texts or email updates, note it so the follow-up team honors their preference.
