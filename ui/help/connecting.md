# Connecting Page Instructions

This transitional page appears while Cloudflare Access is finishing authentication and redirecting you back into the app.

1. Stay on the page—it refreshes automatically once Access is ready.  
2. If you wait more than ~10 seconds, click the manual “Continue” link to resume.  
3. Only reload if instructed; repeated refreshes can interrupt the Access handshake.  
4. If you see an error banner, copy the error ID and share it with the tech team.

This page never collects volunteer data; it exists solely to show friendly messaging while Access completes.
