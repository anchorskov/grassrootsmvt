# Update Contact Form Instructions

This form appears when you’re editing an existing voter record (e.g., after clicking “Note” or “Contact”). It preserves original data while highlighting your changes.

## Workflow
1. **Verify the banner** – Confirm you’re editing the correct voter (name, address, voter ID).
2. **Review highlighted fields** – Yellow fields show differences from the official file; double-check accuracy.
3. **Capture interaction details & consent** – Contact type, notes, tags, follow-up status, and the Pulse opt-in checkboxes explain what happened. Always confirm the voter’s best cell and email and use the consent script if you’re updating texting permission: _“With your permission we can send brief campaign updates by text or email. Message/data rates may apply and you can reply STOP any time. Is that okay?”_
4. **Save updates** – Click “Save Updates” when everything looks right. The success card provides a quick shortcut back.
5. **Need to abort?** – Click “Discard” to return to the originating page without saving changes.

## Best Practices
- Only edit fields you confirmed with the voter; leave unknown values blank.
- Use the Tags and Follow-up checkbox so coordinators can assign next steps.
- Note opt-outs (text or email) immediately so we do not re-ask the same voter.
- If you landed here by mistake, discard changes immediately to avoid overwriting another canvasser’s work.
