# Admin Portal Instructions

This page is for organizers and data managers. Volunteers do not typically see it.

## Daily Tasks
1. Review the metrics cards (contacts logged today, outstanding follow-ups, new volunteers).
2. Use the navigation tabs to move between queues (Approvals, Notes, Exports).
3. Drill into a record to audit notes or reassign follow-up owners.
4. Export CSVs only when necessary—each export is logged.

## Access & Safety
- All actions require Cloudflare Access plus the `ADMIN_EMAILS` allow-list.
- Double-check before editing voter data; changes are live.
- Use the help toggle here for tips specific to each admin subpage.
