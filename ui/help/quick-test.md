# Quick Test Page Instructions

This minimalist test harness verifies that essential UI components load (buttons, forms, fetch utilities).

- Use it before large demos to ensure your browser can load our CSS/JS bundles.  
- Click through each control; a green check should appear after successful interactions.  
- If anything fails, capture the console log and send it to engineering.  
- Volunteers generally do not need this page—staff and QA use it during releases.
