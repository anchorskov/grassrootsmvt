# Auth Test Page Instructions

Use this diagnostic page to confirm Cloudflare Access headers are reaching your browser and to capture sample payloads for debugging.

1. Load the page while authenticated through Zero Trust.  
2. Copy the displayed headers or JWTs when engineering asks for examples.  
3. Use the “Refresh” or “Re-run test” controls to capture a new snapshot after you change Access policies.  
4. When you are finished, close the page—no volunteer data is stored here.

Tip: If you land here without valid credentials you should be redirected back through Access. Let the infra team know if you see raw 401s or unauthenticated responses.
