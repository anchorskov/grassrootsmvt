# Volunteer Hub Instructions

The hub aggregates shortcuts to every volunteer workflow. Use it as your daily launchpad.

## Quick Start
1. Read the announcement banner for any day-of updates.
2. Choose your activity tile (Calling, Canvassing, Data Entry, Admin tasks).
3. Review the status chips—green tiles are ready, yellow tiles require prep (e.g., download lists).
4. Click the tile to navigate; you’ll remain authenticated through Cloudflare Access.

## Tips
- Bookmark this page; it updates automatically when new programs launch.
- Hover each tile to see a micro-description of what happens when you click it.
- If a tile is disabled, move to another activity or reach out to the volunteer lead shown in the sidebar.
