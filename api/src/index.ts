// api/src/index.ts
// Neutralized: this file previously implemented a separate Worker that handled
// routes such as /whoami. It has been neutralized to avoid shadowing the
// Pages Functions under ui/functions. If you intend to run a standalone
// Worker for API routes, restore the original contents or move them to a
// dedicated Worker deployment. For now this file does nothing.
