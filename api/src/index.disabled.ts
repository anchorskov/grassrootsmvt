// Disabled backup of api/src/index.ts
// Renamed to avoid shadowing Pages Functions that live under ui/functions.
// If you need to re-enable the API Worker, restore this file to api/src/index.ts
// (or keep it and remove conflicting routes in Pages). Kept as a readonly backup.

/*
PUT BACKUP OF api/src/index.ts HERE - intentionally left as a disabled backup.
This file was renamed to avoid duplicating /whoami in a separate Worker that
could be intercepting requests intended for the Pages Functions under ./ui.
